# Little Game

[toc]



## preface

I have had a great interest in game development since I first started contacting with computers. With the increasing age and a deeper understanding of computers, the initial pure joy seems to have gradually faded away, and programming is now far from what was once thought of as writing various software what we used.

In the environment of junior year, various pressures come one after another. At this time point, I want to do everything and I don't want to do anything either. In this state of idleness and numbness, I want to pursue the once simple happiness and please myself, who seems lost in the present. By chance, I talked to my friend `LKH` about the core logic algorithm of the classic mini game `Minesweeper`. So, taking advantage of this motivation, I started making the first small game in this repository and hoped to take this opportunity to try more things that I had not tried before like posting videos.

I hope this is an opportunity to immerse myself in it and regain the joy of simple programming. People are always accustomed to complaining, but I believe that complaining itself has no effect. Only by trying to change it can everything be meaningful.
